  In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God,  Shishijee mli lɛ Wiemɔ lɛ yɛ momo ni Wiemɔ lɛ kɛ Nyɔŋmɔ yɔɔ ni Wiemɔ lɛ Nyɔŋmɔ ni
   He was in the beginning with God,  Lɛ nɔŋŋ shishijee mli lɛ ekɛ Nyɔŋmɔ yɔɔ
   All things were made through Him and without Him nothing was made that was made,  Lɛ enɔ atsɔ̃ afee nibii fɛɛ ni ashiii lɛ afeee nɔ ko nɔ ko ni afee
   In Him was life and the life was the light of men,  Emli wala yɔɔ ni wala lɛ ji gbɔmɛi ala lɛ
   And the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it,  ni la lɛ tsoɔ yɛ duŋ lɛ mli ni duŋ lɛ nyɛɛɛ enɔ eye
   There was a man sent from God whose name was John,  Nuu ko yɛ ni Nyɔŋmɔ tsu lɛ kɛba atsɛɔ lɛ Yohane
   This man came for a witness to bear witness of the Light that all through him might believe,  Eba odaseyeli ni ebaye la lɛ he odase koni mɛi fɛɛ atsɔ̃ enɔ ahe aye
   He was not that Light but was sent to bear witness of that Light,  Jeee lɛ diɛŋtsɛ ji la lɛ shi moŋ eba la lɛ he odaseyeli
   That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world,  Anɔkwa la lɛ ni tsoɔ hãa mɔ fɛɛ mɔ lɛ baa je lɛ mli nɛɛ
   He was in the world and the world was made through Him and the world did not know Him,  Je lɛ mli la lɛ yɔɔ ni enɔ atsɔ̃ afee je lɛ shi je lɛ leee lɛ
   He came to His own and His own did not receive Him,  Lɛ diɛŋtsɛ emɛi aŋɔɔ eba ni mɛi ni ji lɛ diɛŋtsɛ emaŋbii lɛ hereee lɛ
   But as many as received Him to them He gave the right to become children of God to those who believe in His name,  Shi mɛi abɔ ni here lɛ ni amɛhe egbɛi lɛ nɔ amɛye lɛ ehã amɛ hegbɛ akɛ amɛtsɔ̃mɔ Nyɔŋmɔ bii
   who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God,  mɛi ni jeee lá loo heloo loo nuu ko suɔmɔ naa afɔ amɛ yɛ shi moŋ Nyɔŋmɔ fɔ amɛ
   And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld His glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth,  Ni Wiemɔ lɛ tsɔ̃ gbɔmɔ adesa ni ebahi shi yɛ wɔteŋ ni wɔna enunyam lɛ akɛ Tsɛ lɛ Bi koome lɛ anunyam ni dromɔ kɛ anɔkwale eyi lɛ obɔ̃
   John bore witness of Him and cried out saying 'This was He of whom I said 'He who comes after me is preferred before me for He was before me',  Yohane ye ehe odase ni ebo ekɛɛ “Mɔ nɛ ji mɔ ni mikɛɛ yɛ ehe akɛ ‘Mɔ ni baa yɛ misɛɛ lɛ efe mi etsɔ̃ mihiɛ ejaakɛ eyɛ dani miyɔɔ lɛ’ 
   And of His fullness we have all received and grace for grace,  Ejaakɛ ebɔ̃yimɔ lɛ mli jɛ ni wɔ fɛɛ wɔna dromɔ wɔshi dromɔ nɔ
   For the law was given through Moses but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ,  Ejaakɛ Mla lɛ Mose nɔ atsɔ̃ akɛhã shi dromɔ kɛ anɔkwale lɛ Yesu Kristo nɔ etsɔ̃ kɛba
   No one has seen God at any time The only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father He has declared Him,  Nyɔŋmɔ lɛ mɔ ko enako lɛ pɛŋ Bi koome ni yɔɔ Tsɛ lɛ mlishi lɛ lɛ ebajie lɛ shi etsɔ̃ɔ faŋŋ
   Now this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him 'Who are you?',  Ni enɛ ji Yohane odase ni eye be ni Yudafoi lɛ tsu osɔfoi kɛ Levibii kɛjɛ Yerusalɛm ni amɛbabi lɛ akɛ “Namɔ ji bo?” lɛ
   He confessed and did not deny but confessed 'I am not the Christ',  Ni egba mli faŋŋ ni eshiuuu nɔ ni egba mli akɛ “Jeee mi ji Kristo lɛ”
   And they asked him 'What then? Are you Elijah?' He said 'I am not' 'Are you the Prophet?' And he answered 'No',  Ni amɛbi lɛ akɛ “Namɔ ji bo mɔ? Elia ji bo?” Ni ekɛɛ “Jeee lɛ ji mi” Gbalɔ lɛ ji bo? Ni ehere nɔ ekɛɛ “Dabi”
   Then they said to him 'Who are you that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?',  No hewɔ lɛ amɛbi lɛ akɛ “Namɔ ji bo? (Kɛɛmɔ wɔ) koni wɔna hetoo ko wɔyahã mɛi ni tsu wɔ lɛ Te okɛɔ yɛ bo diɛŋtsɛ ohe tɛŋŋ?”
   He said 'I am 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness Make straight the way of the Lord' as the prophet Isaiah said',  Ekɛɛ “Mi ji mɔ gbee ni boɔ yɛ ŋa lɛ nɔ akɛ ‘Nyɛjajea Nuŋtsɔ lɛ gbɛ lɛ’ ” tamɔ bɔ ni gbalɔ Yesaia kɛɛ lɛ
   Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees,  Ni mɛi ni atsu lɛ jɛ Farisifoi lɛ ateŋ
   And they asked him saying 'Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?',  ni amɛbi lɛ akɛ “Kɛjeee Kristo lɛ loo Elia loo gbalɔ lɛ ji bo lɛ mɛɛ hewɔ obaptisiɔ mɔ?”
   John answered them saying 'I baptize with water but there stands One among you whom you do not know,  Yohane here amɛ nɔ ekɛɛ “Mi lɛ mibaptisiɔ yɛ nu mli shi mɔ ko damɔ nyɛteŋ ni nyɛ lɛ nyɛleee lɛ
   It is He who coming after me is preferred before me whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose',  lɛ ji mɔ ni baa yɛ misɛɛ mɔ tokota naakpãa ni misaaa mɔ ni fɛneɔ lɛ”
   These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan where John was baptizing,  Afee nii nɛɛ yɛ Betania yɛ Yordan sɛɛ he ni Yohane baptisiɔ yɛ lɛ
   The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said 'Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!',  Enɔ jetsɛremɔ lɛ Yohane na Yesu miiba eŋɔɔ ni ekɛɛ “Naa Nyɔŋmɔ Toobi lɛ ni woɔ je lɛ esha lɛ kɛyaa lɛ!
   This is He of whom I said 'After me comes a Man who is preferred before me for He was before me',  Mɔ nɛ ji mɔ ni mikɛɛ yɛ ehe akɛ ‘Nuu ko miiba yɛ misɛɛ ni etsɔ̃ mihiɛ ejaakɛ eyɛ dani miyɔɔ lɛ’
   I did not know Him but that He should be revealed to Israel therefore I came baptizing with water',  Ni mi lɛ́ mileee lɛ shi moŋ bɔ ni afee ni ajie lɛ kpo atsɔ̃ɔ Israel hewɔ ni miba mibaptisiɔ yɛ nu mli nɛɛ”
   And John bore witness saying 'I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and He remained upon Him',  Ni Yohane ye odase ekɛɛ “Mina Mumɔ lɛ yi shi kɛjɛ ŋwɛi tamɔ okpo ni ebahi enɔ
   I did not know Him but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me 'Upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit',  Ni mi lɛ mileee lɛ shi mɔ ni tsu mi akɛ mibaptisi yɛ nu mli lɛ lɛ nɔŋŋ ekɛɛ mi akɛ ‘Mɔ nɔ ni ooona akɛ Mumɔ lɛ yiɔ ni ehiɔ enɔ lɛ lɛ ji mɔ ni baptisiɔ yɛ Mumɔ Krɔŋkrɔŋ mli lɛ’
   And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God',  Ni mina ni miye he odase akɛ Nyɔŋmɔ Bi lɛ nɛ
   Again the next day John stood with two of his disciples,  Asaŋ enɔ jetsɛremɔ lɛ Yohane kɛ ekaselɔi lɛ ateŋ mɛi enyɔ damɔ shi
   And looking at Jesus as He walked he said 'Behold the Lamb of God!',  y ni be ni Yesu hoɔ lɛ ekwɛ lɛ ni ekɛɛ “Naa Nyɔŋmɔ Toobi lɛ!”
   The two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus,  Ni kaselɔi enyɔ lɛ nu ewiemɔ lɛ ni amɛyanyiɛ Yesu sɛɛ
   Then Jesus turned and seeing them following said to them 'What do you seek?' They said to Him 'Rabbi' (which is to say when translated Teacher) 'where are You staying?',  Ni Yesu tsɔ̃ ehe ni be ni ena akɛ amɛnyiɛ esɛɛ lɛ ebi amɛ akɛ “Mɛni nyɛtaoɔ?” Ni amɛkɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Rabi” (eshishi ji Tsɔɔlɔ) “Nɛgbɛ ohiɔ?”
   He said to them 'Come and see' They came and saw where He was staying and remained with Him that day Now it was about the tenth hour,  Ekɛɛ amɛ akɛ “Nyɛbaa ni nyɛbakwɛa” No hewɔ lɛ amɛtee ni amɛyana he ni ehiɔ lɛ ni amɛkɛ lɛ hi shi nakai gbi lɛ Ni gbɛkɛ ŋmɛji ejwɛ mli ni
   One of the two who heard John speak and followed Him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother,  Mɛi enyɔ lɛ ni nu ni Yohane wie ni amɛyanyiɛ Yesu sɛɛ lɛ ateŋ mɔ kome ji Andrea Simon Petro nyɛmi lɛ
   He first found his own brother Simon and said to him 'We have found the Messiah' (which is translated the Christ),  Lɛ eyana lɛ diɛŋtsɛ enyɛmi Simon tsutsu ni ekɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Wɔna Mesia (ni eshishi ji Kristo) loo (mɔ ni afɔ lɛ mu) lɛ”
   And he brought him to Jesus Now when Jesus looked at him He said 'You are Simon the son of Jonah You shall be called Cephas' (which is translated A Stone),  Ni ekɛ lɛ ba Yesu ŋɔɔ Ni Yesu kwɛ lɛ ni ekɛɛ “Bo ji Simon Yona bi lɛ aaatsɛ bo Kefa (eshishi ji Petro loo tɛsaa)”
  The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee and He found Philip and said to him 'Follow Me',  Asaŋ enɔ jetsɛremɔ lɛ Yesu pɛ he yɛ Galileea ni eba Filipo ni ekɛɛ “Ena akɛ”
   Now Philip was from Bethsaida the city of Andrew and Peter,  Ni Filipo lɛ he Betzaida lɛ ni Andrea ni Petro mɛi
   Philip found Nathanael and said to him 'We have found Him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph',  Filipo eba Nathanael ni ekɛɛ “Wɔna he ni Mosa lɛ yɛ Mla lɛ ni yesi Yesu Nazareth Yosɛf bi lɛ”
   And Nathanael said to him 'Can anything good come out of Nazareth?' Philip said to him 'Come and see',  Ni Nathanael eba lɛ akɛ “Loo Nazareth eya naa fɛɛ?” Filipo ekɛɛ “Nyɛbaa ni nyɛbakwɛa”
   Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said of him 'Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no deceit!',  Yesu na Nathanael ye nɔ eŋɔɔ ni ekɛɛ nɔ “Naa ɔyɛ Israelite he nɔ neɛ ekɛ naa bi”
   Nathanael said to Him 'How do You know me?' Jesus answered and said to him 'Before Philip called you when you were under the fig tree I saw you',  Nathanael eba lɛ akɛ “Dɛn na ohi tsɔ?” Yesu ye nɔ “Fɛlɛma na Philip ba ɔ lɛ nɛbo kɛ amɛ lɛ yɛ kwaele jɛmɛ mina”
   Nathanael answered and said to Him 'Rabbi You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!',  Nathanael ye nɔ “Rabi oji Nyɔŋmɔ Bi lɛ! Oji Israel Onya!”
   Jesus answered and said to him 'Because I said to you 'I saw you under the fig tree do you believe? You will see greater things than these',  Yesu ye nɔ “Mɛlɛ jɛmɔ lɛ ‘Mina nɛbo kɛ amɛ lɛ yɛ kwaele jɛmɛ’ Lɛ bɔ ɔ bɔ he nyɛka ahyɛ lɛ
   And He said to him 'Most assuredly I say to you hereafter you shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man',  Ni ekɛɛ “Mɛda nu miye jɛmɔ lɛ ni he lɛ ye nɛbɔɔ gbɔmɔ bɛ ejahe lɛ ni nyɛmli Nyoŋmɔ ye ye lɛ kɛ fɛfɛ wɔna ejahe nyɛ”
   On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there,  Enɔ gbii etɛ̃ lɛ akpee yoo yɛ Kana yɛ Galilea ni Yesu nyɛ yɛ jɛi
   Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding,  Ni akpee Yesu hu kɛ ekaselɔi lɛ kɛtee yookpeemɔ lɛ
   And when they ran out of wine the mother of Jesus said to Him 'They have no wine',  Ni be ni wain lɛ tã lɛ Yesu nyɛ kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Amɛbɛ wain”
   Jesus said to her 'Woman what does your concern have to do with Me? My hour has not yet come',  a Yesu kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Ohe sane mɛ ji no Awo? Miŋmlɛtswaa lɛ shɛko”
   His mother said to the servants 'Whatever He says to you do it',  Enyɛ kɛɛ tsuji lɛ akɛ “Nɔ fɛɛ nɔ ni eeekɛɛ nyɛ lɛ nyɛfea”
   Now there were set there six waterpots of stone according to the manner of purification of the Jews containing twenty or thirty gallons apiece,  b Ni tɛ botokui ekpaa mamɔ shi yɛ jɛi yɛ Yudafoi lɛ ahetsuumɔ hewɔ ekome yeɔ susumɔ gbɛi enyɔ loo etɛ̃
   Jesus said to them 'Fill the waterpots with water' And they filled them up to the brim,  Yesu kɛɛ amɛ akɛ “Nyɛwoa botokui lɛ amli nu obɔ̃bɔ̃” Ni amɛwo amɛ obɔ̃bɔ̃ɔbɔ̃
   And He said to them 'Draw some out now and take it to the master of the feast' And they took it,  Ni ekɛɛ amɛ akɛ “Nyɛyɛa eko nyɛyahãa piafonyo lɛ” Ni amɛyɛ kɛtee
   When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew) the master of the feast called the bridegroom,  Shi be ni piafonyo lɛ sa enaa nu ni etsɔ̃ wain ni eleee he ni jɛ shi tsuji lɛ ni yɛ nu lɛ kɛkɛ le lɛ etsɛ ayɛmforowu lɛ
   And he said to him 'Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine and when the guests have well drunk then the inferior You have kept the good wine until now!',  ni ekɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Mɔ fɛɛ mɔ lɛ wain kpakpa ekɛbamaa shi klɛŋklɛŋ ni kɛ mɛi lɛ etɔrɔ lɛ no dani ekɛ nɔ ni eŋɔɔɔ lɛ baa shi bo lɛ okɛ wain kpakpa lɛ moŋ eto kɛbashi benɛ”
   This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee and manifested His glory and His disciples believed in Him,  Enɛ Yesu fee yɛ Kana yɛ Galilea ekɛje ekadii ashishi ni ekɛ enunyam lɛ tsɔ̃ɔ ni ekaselɔi lɛ he enɔ amɛye
   After this He went down to Capernaum He His mother His brothers and His disciples and they did not stay there many days,  Enɛ sɛɛ lɛ eyiŋ etee Kapernaum lɛ kɛ enyɛ kɛ enyɛmimɛi kɛ ekaselɔi lɛ shi amɛyeee gbii pii ko yɛ jɛi
   Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,  Yesu tsuu Sɔlemɔ we lɛ he
   And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves and the money changers doing business,  Ni eyana mɛi ni hɔ̃ɔ tsinai kɛ toi kɛ okpoi kɛ mɛi ni tsakeɔ shika hu tara shi yɛ amɛkpɔlɔ̃i ahe yɛ Sɔlemɔ we lɛ
   When He had made a whip of cords He drove them all out of the temple with the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers' money and overturned the tables,  Ni ekɛ taŋkpei bibii fee kpelebii ni ekɛshwie amɛ fɛɛ kɛ toi kɛ tsinai lɛ kɛje Sɔlemɔ we lɛ ni etsɔ̃ shikatsakelɔi lɛ ashika lɛ eshwie shi ni etsirɛ okpɔlɔi lɛ etswia shi
   And He said to those who sold doves 'Take these things away! Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise!',  ni ekɛɛ mɛi ni hɔ̃ɔ okpoi lɛ akɛ “Nyɛjiea nii nɛɛ kɛjea biɛ nyɛkɛ miTsɛ we lɛ akafea jara nɔ”
   Then His disciples remembered that it was written 'Zeal for Your house has eaten Me up',  f Shi ekaselɔi lɛ kai akɛ aŋma akɛ “Owe lɛ he hiɛdɔɔ lɛ eye mi”
   So the Jews answered and said to Him 'What sign do You show to us since You do these things?',  g Kɛkɛ ni Yudafoi lɛ bi lɛ akɛ “Mɛɛ okadi okɛtsɔ̃ɔ wɔ akɛ oyɛ hegbɛ akɛ ofeɔ enɛɛmɛi nɛɛ?”
   Jesus answered and said to them 'Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up',  h Yesu here nɔ ni ekɛɛ amɛ akɛ “Nyɛkumɔa sɔlemɔtsu nɛɛ ni gbii etɛ̃ mli lɛ mama ekoŋŋ”
   Then the Jews said 'It has taken forty-six years to build this temple and will You raise it up in three days?',  Kɛkɛ lɛ Yudafoi lɛ kɛɛ “Afii nyɔŋmai ejwɛ kɛ ekpaa akɛma Sɔlemɔtsu nɛɛ ni bo lɛ gbii etɛ̃ okɛaama lo?”
   But He was speaking of the temple of His body,  Shi lɛ lɛ egbɔmɔtso akɛ Sɔlemɔtsu lɛ he ewieɔ lɛ
   Therefore when He had risen from the dead His disciples remembered that He had said this to them and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said,  No hewɔ lɛ be ni ete shi kɛjɛ gbohii ateŋ lɛ ekaselɔi lɛ kai akɛ ekɛɛ enɛ ni amɛhe ŋmalɛ lɛ kɛ wiemɔ ni Yesu wie lɛ amɛye
   Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast many believed in His name when they saw the signs which He did,  Agbɛnɛ be ni Yesu yɔɔ Yerusalɛm yɛ Hehoo Gbijurɔ lɛ mli lɛ mɛi pii na okadii ni efee lɛ ni amɛhe egbɛi lɛ nɔ amɛye
   But Jesus did not commit Himself to them because He knew all men,  Shi Yesu diɛŋtsɛ lɛ ekɛ ehe efɔ̃ɔɔ amɛnɔ ejaakɛ ele amɛ fɛɛ amɛsu
   and had no need that anyone should testify of man for He knew what was in man,  j Ni ehe ehĩaaa akɛ mɔ ko aye gbɔmɔ he odase ahã lɛ ejaakɛ lɛ diɛŋtsɛ ele nɔ ni yɔɔ gbɔmɔ tsui mli
   There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews,  Nuu ko yɛ ni jɛ Farisifoi lɛ ateŋ ni atsɛɔ lɛ Nikodemo ni ji Yudafoi lɛ anukpa
   This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him 'Rabbi we know that You are a teacher come from God for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him',  lɛ eba Yesu ŋɔɔ nyɔɔŋ ni ebakɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Rabi wɔle akɛ tsɔɔlɔ ni jɛ Nyɔŋmɔ ŋɔɔ ba ji bo ejaakɛ mɔ ko nyɛŋ afee okadii ni ofeɔ nɛɛ akɛ ja Nyɔŋmɔ kɛ mɔ lɛ yɛ”
   Jesus answered and said to him 'Most assuredly I say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God',  b Yesu here nɔ ni ekɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Anɔkwale mikɛɔ bo akɛ kɛji ajɛɛɛ ŋwɛi afɔɔɔ mɔ ko lɛ enyɛŋ Nyɔŋmɔ maŋtsɛyeli lɛ ena”
   Nicodemus said to Him 'How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?',  Nikodemo bi lɛ akɛ “Te aaafee tɛŋŋ ni be ni gbɔmɔ egbɔ lɛ ni aaafɔ lɛŋ? Ani eeenyɛ ebote enyɛ musu mli ekoŋŋ ni afɔ lɛ?”
   Jesus answered 'Most assuredly I say to you unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God',  c Yesu here nɔ akɛ “Miikɛɛ bo anɔkwale akɛ nɔ ni wɔle lɛ no wɔwieɔ ni nɔ ni wɔna lɛ no he odase wɔyeɔ shi nyɛŋɔɔɔ wɔdase lɛ
   That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit,  d Nɔ ni ajɛ heloo mli afɔ lɛ heloo ni ni nɔ ni ajɛ Mumɔ mli afɔ lɛ mumɔ ni
   Do not marvel that I said to you 'You must be born again',  Ohiɛ akafee bo yaa akɛ mikɛɛ bo akɛ 'ja ajɛ ŋwɛi afɔ nyɛ' lɛ
   The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes So is everyone who is born of the Spirit,  Kɔɔyɔɔ lɛ he ni esumɔɔ etswaa kɛyaa ni egbɛɛmɔ onuɔ shi oleee he ni ejɛɔ kɛ he ni eyaa nakai ji mɔ fɛɛ mɔ ni ajɛ Mumɔ mli afɔ lɛ lɛ
   Nicodemus answered and said to Him 'How can these things be?',  Nikodemo here nɔ ni ebi lɛ akɛ “Te aaafee tɛŋŋ ni nii nɛɛ aaanyɛ aba mli hu?”
   Jesus answered and said to him 'Are you the teacher of Israel and do not know these things?',  Yesu here nɔ ni ekɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Te Israel tsɔɔlɔ ji bo? Ni oleee enɛɛmɛi nɛɛ?
   Most assuredly I say to you we speak what we know and testify what we have seen and you do not receive our witness,  e Miikɛɛ bo anɔkwale akɛ nɔ ni wɔle lɛ no wɔwieɔ ni nɔ ni wɔna lɛ no he odase wɔyeɔ shi nyɛŋɔɔɔ wɔdase lɛ

   that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life,  koni mɔ fɛɛ mɔ ni heɔ enɔ eyeɔ lɛ ana naanɔ wala
   For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life,  h “Ejaakɛ nɛkɛ Nyɔŋmɔ sumɔ je lɛ akɛ eŋɔ eBi koome lɛ ehã koni mɔ fɛɛ mɔ ni heɔ enɔ yeɔ lɛ hiɛ akakpãtã shi moŋ ena naanɔ wala

   He who believes in Him is not condemned but he who does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God,  j Mɔ ni heɔ enɔ yeɔ lɛ akojooo lɛ shi mɔ ni heee yeee lɛ akojo lɛ momo ejaakɛ eheko Nyɔŋmɔ Bi koome lɛ gbɛi lɛ nɔ eyeko

   For John had not yet been thrown into prison,  n ejaakɛ no mli lɛ anako awo Yohane tsuŋ
   Then there arose a dispute between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purification,  Agbɛnɛ naataamɔ bate shi yɛ Yohane kaselɔi lɛ kɛ Yudafonyo ko teŋ yɛ hetsuumɔ he

   He left Judea and departed again to Galilee,  eje Yudea ni eyiŋ etee Galilea ekoŋŋ
   But He needed to go through Samaria,  Shi ja etsɔ̃ Samaria
   So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph,  Agbɛnɛ ebashɛ Samaria maŋ ko ni atsɛɔ lɛ Sikar ni bɛŋkɛ shikpɔŋ kukuoo ko ni Yakob kɛhã ebi Yosef lɛ masɛi
   Now Jacob’s well was there Jesus therefore being wearied from His journey sat thus by the well It was about the sixth hour,  Shi Yakob nubu lɛ yɛ jɛi Ni akɛni gbɛnyiɛmɔ lɛ etɔ Yesu hewɔ lɛ eho eshwata shi yɛ nubu lɛ he Ebashɛ jɛi aaafee ŋmɛlɛ nyɔŋma kɛ enyɔ mli
   A woman of Samaria came to draw water Jesus said to her 'Give Me a drink',  Ni Samariayoo ko ba nuyɛɛ Yesu kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Hã mi nu lɛ eko manu”
   For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food,  No mli lɛ ekaselɔi lɛ etee maŋ lɛ mli amɛyaahe niyenii
   Then the woman of Samaria said to Him 'How is it that You being a Jew ask a drink from me a Samaritan woman?' For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans,  Kɛkɛ lɛ Samariayoo lɛ kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Te tɛŋŋ ni bo Yudanyo lɛ obaa mi Samariayoo lɛ nu ni onuŋ?” (Ejaakɛ Yudafoi kɛ Samariabii enuuu tsene kome naa nu)
   Jesus answered and said to her 'If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you “Give Me a drink” you would have asked Him and He would have given you living water',  Yesu here nɔ ni ekɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Eji ole Nyɔŋmɔ nɔkeenɔ lɛ kɛ mɔ ni kɛɔ bo akɛ ‘Hã mi eko manu lɛ’ kulɛ bo moŋ oooba lɛ ni eeehã bo wala nu”
   The woman said to Him 'Sir You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep Where then do You get that living water?,  Yoo lɛ kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Nuŋtsɔ obɛ nɔ ni okɛaayɛ ni bu lɛ mli kwɔ hu nɛgbɛ ona wala nu lɛ yɛ mɔ?

   Jesus answered and said to her 'Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again,  Yesu here nɔ ni ekɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Mɔ fɛɛ mɔ ni nuɔ nu nɛɛ lɛ kumai baaye lɛ ekoŋŋ
   but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life',  shi mɔ ni nuɔ nu ni mi mahã lɛ lɛ kumai yeŋ lɛ dɔŋŋ kɛaatee naanɔ shi moŋ nu ni mahã lɛ lɛ aaatsɔ̃ nu hiŋmɛi ni baa kɛyaa naanɔ wala mli yɛ emli

   Jesus said to her 'Go call your husband and come here',  Yesu kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Yaa ni oyatsɛ owu ni okɛ lɛ aba biɛ”
   The woman answered and said 'I have no husband' Jesus said to her 'You have well said 'I have no husband',  Yoo lɛ here nɔ ni ekɛɛ akɛ “Mibɛ wu” Yesu kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Ojogbaŋŋ okɛɛ akɛ ‘mibɛ wu’ lɛ
   for you have had five husbands and the one whom you now have is not your husband in that you spoke truly',  ejaakɛ ogbã hii enumɔ ni mɔ ni ogbãa amrɔ nɛɛ tete jeee owu ji lɛ no lɛ owie anɔkwa
   The woman said to Him 'Sir I perceive that You are a prophet,  Yoo lɛ kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Nuŋtsɔ mina akɛ gbalɔ ji bo

   Jesus said to her 'Woman believe Me the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father,  Yesu kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Yoo lɛ mɔ lɛ me gboŋ jee wɔbɛɔ he ne yɛ nɛ ɔtɛlɛ kɛ nɛ mɔ fa si nnɛ nɔ asɔle ɔhe ni yɛ bɛ nɔ to he mɔ nɔbɛ nɔ

   But the hour is coming and now is when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth for the Father is seeking such to worship Him,  Shi ɔtɛlɛ lɛ yɛ ja e ni le eyo ni ogbɔ sɔlɔfoɔ bɛyɛ ɔtsɛmɛi he ni ni kɛbɛnɛ nyɔŋmɔ ni nyɔŋmɔ le nyɛmɔɛ to
   God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth',  Nyɔŋmɔ yɛŋbɔ ni yɛ ɔtsɛmɛi he yɛŋbɔ nɛɛ kɛ da ni e
   The woman said to Him 'I know that Messiah is coming' (who is called Christ) 'When He comes He will tell us all things',  Yoo lɛ kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Mina akɛ hɛn ɛbuɛ ni Ɔŋɛa ɔyɔ ni ɔjɛe lɛ aseyoo ‘Eji ɔ hɛn jɛ e hɛn mɛ nɛ eshɛɛ”
   Jesus said to her 'I who speak to you am He',  Yesu kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Mii nɛ ɖa nu lɛ ǃ
   And at this point His disciples came and they marveled that He talked with a woman yet no one said 'What do You seek?' or 'Why are You talking with her?',  Eshyɛ ee lɛ ekaselɔi lɛ mli kɛɛ ni ɛbɔda eeyɛsɛ ebi mli “Ewo eaa eyaa?” ni mɔ “Ni nɛtɛɔe lɛ? 
   The woman then left her water pot went her way into the city and said to the men,  Yoo lɛ gbalɔ lɛ mɔ nɔ dɔmɛi bɛ nɔ kɛ nɔ yɛ onuklɔɔi ni nɛbɛnii
   'Come see a Man who told me all things that I ever did Could this be the Christ?',  “Nɔ bɛ Sɛn kɛi lɛ maŋ mɔ nɔ ni yɛhɛn ti Nɛne ni Yuda?
   Then they went out of the city and came to Him,  Eshyɛe akɛɛ ɛyi hɛ wɔ mli nyɛ gbetii nɔ
   In the meantime His disciples urged Him saying 'Rabbi eat',  Ni ekaselɔi lɛ nɔ akɛ mɔkɔɔɔ yɛɛ ni “Rabbi ŋɔ mli”
   But He said to them 'I have food to eat of which you do not know',  Shi Yesu kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Mi nɔ mli nɔ ɛnɛ o hɛnni”
   Therefore the disciples said to one another 'Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?',  Agbɛnɛ ekaselɔi lɛ kɛɛ lɛ “Ewɔ mli nɔ bɛ kɛɛ nɔ?”
   Jesus said to them 'My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work',  Yesu kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Mii nɔ nɔ eho ni a nɛ nɔkɔ ni mli a ɖaa mɛ
   Do you not say 'There are still four months and then comes the harvest?' Behold I say to you lift up your eyes and look at the fields for they are already white for harvest!,  Ani ɛnyɛɔ “Gbekɛŋŋ nɔlɛ ayɛtsɛi fɔrɔ?” Ani ni ɖeŋɛɛ kɛɔ ni hɛn lo hɛn na a lɛ ha
   And he who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together,  Ni ogbɛɛ nɔ yɛ mɔ ni ɔnɔ yɛ nyɛmɔ jɛ ɔyɔ ǃ
   For in this the saying is true 'One sows and another reaps',  Jɔ eho ni nsɛe sɛ ‘mɔ sɔ ni onyi ohuu”
   I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored others have labored and you have entered into their labors',  Mi ba yɛ sɔmɛi ni a mɔ lɛ ɛhe ɔyɔji ni mɔ jɛ mɔ
   And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified 'He told me all that I ever did',  Ni ɔbo nɔ bɛ bɛɛ ɔha bɛɛ mɔ ni lɛ onuklɔɔ lɛ ni ‘eji ɖaa mɔ’
   So when the Samaritans had come to Him they urged Him to stay with them and He stayed there two days,  Agbɛnɛ be nɔ bɛ Sɛn mɔ ni etɔ akɛ nɔ fɛɛ
   And many more believed because of His own word,  Ni ɔbo be lɛɛ jɛ ɔyɔ mɔ
   Then they said to the woman 'Now we believe not because of what you said for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the Christ the Savior of the world',  Ehyɛ lɛ “Nɔ lɛ hɛn ji nɛ bɔ mɔ hɛn no nɛ lɛ ɖee”
   Now after the two days He departed from there and went to Galilee,  Eno lɛ ni Yesu eba nɔ gbetii Galilea
   For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country,  Ni Yesu kɛɛ nɛ Ni ɔkɛfoɔ nɔ le tɛɛlɛ nɔ
   So when He came to Galilee the Galileans received Him having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast for they also had gone to the feast,  Eji ɔ mɛni Galilea ni Galileans tɔɔ mɔ nɔ ni nɔ lɛ yɛ he gbetii
   So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum,  Eji Yesu yɛ ƒe nɔ ni ne ba nɔ lɛ gbɛi ni bɛ nɛ lɛ he
   When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee he went to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death,  Ni mɔ ekase ni Yesu kɛɛ lɛ Yuda mɔ ja mɔ ni nɛa nɛ bo ni ɔyɛ lɛ
   Then Jesus said to him 'Unless you people see signs and wonders you will by no means believe',  Eji Yesu kɛɛ nɛ “Ni ɔtsɛmɛi hɛn ni mɔ hɛn ji”
   The nobleman said to Him 'Sir come down before my child dies!',  Nɛ nɛ nɛ 'Ayi hɛn ɔyɛ! Nɛ hɛn na nɔ! 
   Jesus said to him 'Go your way your son lives!' So the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and he went his way,  Yesu kɛɛ nɛ 'Nɔ lɛ nɛ ba na a ni mɔ yɛn he
   And as he was now going down his servants met him and told him saying 'Your son lives!',  Eshyɛ ee nɔ lɛ nɛ ɔyɔ nɔ ɔda ni nɔ yɛ aji lɛ 'Nɛ ba na a!'
   Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better And they said to him 'Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him',  Eji ɔɔ ehiɔ ni ɛbɔda ɛdɔmɛi 'Nɛ nɔ ɖɔmɛi kɛ pɛ nɛ nɔ yɛ a a wɔlɛ he
   So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him 'Your son lives' And he himself believed and his whole household,  Ni ɔba fɔɔ lɛ ni wɔ gbɛi ni a ɔyɛ nɛ lɛ 'Nɛ ba lɛ'
   This again is the second sign Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into Galilee,  Lɛ ebi lɛ yɛ ɔsɔsɔ ni Yesu yɛ lɛ Yuda bɛ tɔ Galilea
After this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,  Enɛ sɛɛ lɛ Yudafoi lɛ agbijurɔ ko bashɛ ni Yesu tee Yerusalɛm
   Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool which is called in Hebrew Bethesda having five porches,  Kpaakpo ko yɛ Yerusalɛm yɛ Toi Agboi lɛ masɛi ni Hebri wiemɔ mli lɛ atsɛɔ lɛ Betesda ni koii enumɔ yɛ he
   In these lay a great multitude of sick people blind lame paralyzed waiting for the moving of the water,  Enɛɛmɛi amli helatsɛmɛi pii — shwilafoi akpakei kɛ obubuafoi — kãmɔ ni amɛmɛɔ nu lɛ mlitaa
   For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water then whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made well of whatever disease he had,  Ejaakɛ bei komɛi lɛ ŋwɛi bɔfo ko kpelekeɔ shi kɛbaa kpaakpo lɛ mli ni ebataa nu lɛ mli kɛkɛ lɛ emlitaa lɛ sɛɛ lɛ mɔ fɛɛ mɔ ni yagbeɔ nu lɛ mli tsutsu lɛ hela fɛɛ hela ni eyeɔ lɛ ehe tãa
   Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years,  Nuu ko yɛ jɛi ni ehe eye afii nyɔŋmai etɛ̃ kɛ kpaanyɔ
   When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he already had been in that condition a long time He said to him 'Do you want to be made well?',  Yesu na lɛ ni ekã shi ni akɛni ele akɛ etsɛ aahu lɛ ebi lɛ akɛ 'Oosumɔ akɛ ohe awa bo lo?'
   The sick man answered Him 'Sir I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up but while I am coming another steps down before me',  Helatsɛ lɛ here lɛ nɔ akɛ 'Nuŋtsɔ mibɛ mɔ ko ni kɛ abata nu lɛ mli ni eeewo mi eyawo kpaakpo lɛ mli shi kɛ miiya lɛ mɔ kroko tsɔ̃ɔ mihiɛ eyagbeɔ mli'
   Jesus said to him 'Rise take up your bed and walk',  a Yesu kɛɛ lɛ akɛ 'Tee shi kɔ osaa lɛ ni onyiɛ!'
   And immediately the man was made well took up his bed and walked And that day was the Sabbath,  b Ni amrɔ lɛ gbɔmɔ lɛ he wa lɛ ni ewo esaa lɛ ni enyiɛ
   The Jews therefore said to him who was cured 'It is the Sabbath it is not lawful for you to carry your bed',  c No hewɔ lɛ Yudafoi lɛ kɛɛ mɔ ni atsa lɛ akɛ 'hejɔɔmɔ gbi nɛ obɛ hegbɛ akɛ otereɔ osaa'
   He answered them 'He who made me well said to me “Take up your bed and walk”',  Ehere amɛ nɔ akɛ 'Mɔ ni tsa mi lɛ lɛ ekɛɛ mi akɛ ‘Kɔ osaa lɛ ni onyiɛ’ '
   Then they asked him 'Who is the Man who said to you “Take up your bed and walk?”',  Amɛbi lɛ akɛ 'Namɔ ji mɔ ni kɛɛ bo akɛ ‘Kɔ osaa lɛ ni onyiɛ’ lɛ?'
   But the one who was healed did not know who it was for Jesus had withdrawn a multitude being in that place,  Shi mɔ ni atsa lɛ leee mɔ ni ji ejaakɛ mɛi pii yɛ jɛi ni Yesu egbala ehe shi
   Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him 'See you have been made well Sin no more lest a worse thing come upon you',  d Fee sɛɛ lɛ Yesu yana lɛ yɛ Sɔlemɔ we lɛ ni ekɛɛ lɛ akɛ 'Naa ohe ewa bo kaafee esha dɔŋŋ koni efɔŋ ni fe tsutsu nɔ lɛ akaba onɔ'
   The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well,  Nuu lɛ yiŋ etee ni eyagba Yudafoi lɛ akɛ Yesu ji mɔ ni tsa lɛ lɛ
   For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him because He had done these things on the Sabbath,  e No hewɔ lɛ Yudafoi lɛ jie amɛhiɛ amɛka Yesu ejaakɛ hejɔɔmɔ gbi lɛ nɔ efee nii nɛɛ
   But Jesus answered them 'My Father has been working until now and I have been working',  f Shi Yesu here amɛ nɔ ekɛɛ 'MiTsɛ miitsu nii kɛbashi be nɛ ni mi hu miitsu'
   Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him because He not only broke the Sabbath but also said that God was His Father making Himself equal with God,  g No hewɔ titri Yudafoi lɛ taoɔ lɛ agbe lɛ ejaakɛ jeee akɛ ebule hejɔɔmɔ gbi lɛ kɛkɛ shi asaŋ etsɛ Nyɔŋmɔ akɛ lɛ diɛŋtsɛ eTsɛ ni efee ehe akɛ mɔ ko ni kɛ Nyɔŋmɔ ye hegbɔ
   Then Jesus answered and said to them 'Most assuredly I say to you the Son can do nothing of Himself but what He sees the Father do for whatever He does the Son also does in like manner',  No hewɔ lɛ Yesu here nɔ ekɛɛ amɛ akɛ 'Anɔkwale mikɛɔ nyɛ akɛ Bi lɛ diɛŋtsɛ nyɛŋ eto eyiŋ efee nɔ ko ja nɔ ni ena akɛ Tsɛ lɛ miifee ejaakɛ nibii fɛɛ ni Tsɛ lɛ feɔ lɛ nomɛi nɔŋŋ Bi lɛ hu feɔ

   Now when evening came His disciples went down to the sea,  Be ni shɛ gbɛkɛnaashi lɛ ekaselɔi lɛ yiŋ kɛtee ŋshɔ lɛ naa
   They got into the boat and went over the sea toward Capernaum And it was already dark and Jesus had not come to them,  ni amɛyabote lɛlɛ mli ni amɛmiifo ŋshɔ lɛ kɛya Kapernaum Shi duŋ ewo fɛɛ lɛ Yesu bako amɛŋɔɔ lolo
   Then the sea arose because a great wind was blowing,  ni ahum ko ni batswa hewɔ lɛ ŋshɔ lɛ fite
   So when they had rowed about three or four miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat and they were afraid,  Be ni amɛwiri aaafee shitoi etɛ̃ loo ejwɛ lɛ amɛna Yesu ni enyiɛ ŋshɔ lɛ hiɛ ni eebɛŋkɛ lɛlɛ lɛ ni amɛshe gbeyei
   But He said to them 'It is I do not be afraid',  Shi ekɛɛ amɛ akɛ “Miŋ nyɛkashea gbeyei”
   Then they willingly received Him into the boat and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going,  No hewɔ lɛ amɛkɛ miishɛɛ ŋɔ lɛ kɛba lɛlɛ lɛ ni nɛ kɛɛ lɛ lɛ lɛlii
   On the following day when the people who were standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except that one which His disciples had entered and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples,  Nɛ mɛtsɛ lɛ lɛ be ni mɛi lɛ ni yɔɔ naakpɛ lɛ nɛ hahe ni hewɔ mɛkɛɛ ko kɛbi lɛlɛ ni Yesu amɛŋɔɔ lɛ lɛ ahe akeselɔi lɛ

   when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there nor His disciples they also got into boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus,  Be ni amɛyɔɔ lɛ lɛ akɛ ɛnyɛ lɛ naakpɛɛ nii no gɔɔ lɛ amɛkɛ Kapernaum ni mɛyɛ Yesu
   And when they found Him on the other side of the sea they said to Him 'Rabbi when did You come here?',  Ni be ni amɛjɛ lɛ nɛ ahe ḿli lɛ amɛkɛ “Rabbi akɛ ebi enyi fɛɛ lɛ?”
   Jesus answered them and said 'Most assuredly I say to you you seek Me not because you saw the signs but because you ate of the loaves and were filled',  Yesu here ni amɛ “Nɔ lɛ na mɛdɛ amɛi lɛ ebi nɛ abɛyɛ nɛ jɛ etɛ bɔ ni amɛyewo”
   Do not labor for the food which perishes but for the food which endures to everlasting life which the Son of Man will give you because God the Father has set His seal on Him',  Nɛ mɛbɛn ni aheyebɔ lɛ nɛ ni yɔɔ aheyɛ lɛ ni Son ni Onya eba ni eban lɛ ni Nyankopɔn Otuya ŋwɛ hɛn ɛka ahe onyaa
   Then they said to Him 'What shall we do that we may work the works of God?',  Ni amɛhe lɛ nɔ akɛ “Gbekɛ ebi lɛ nɛ nɛ ɛhe ni amɛyeyɔ Nyankopɔn ahe?”
   Jesus answered and said to them 'This is the work of God that you believe in Him whom He sent',  Yesu here nɔ akɛ “Eni lɛ Nyankopɔn ni ebi yɛn ahe mi yɔɔ”
   Therefore they said to Him 'What sign will You perform then that we may see it and believe You? What work will You do?,  Kɛkɛ ni amɛhe lɛ nɔ akɛ “Gbekɛ ebi lɛ ni ekɛ mɛnɛ amɛna mɛa ebi yɛ? Nɛ nɛyi lɛ nɛ?
   Our fathers ate the manna in the desert as it is written 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat'\,  Amɛfɛni ateɛ ahe nɛ daami ni ahe ahe buɔ “Eka heyei ahe mɛtɔ ahe”\
   Then Jesus said to them 'Most assuredly I say to you Moses did not give you the bread from heaven but My Father gives you the true bread from heaven,  Shi Yesu here nɔ akɛ “Nɔ lɛ nɛ Mɔsɛ nɛbɛn naɛ lɛ ahe ahe nɛ mɛsɛmɛn ahe ŋwɛ fɛɛ tɛkɛ ahe”

   Then they said to Him 'Lord give us this bread always',  Ni amɛhe nɔ akɛ “Ayi mɛshe no ahe lɛ”

   This is the will of the Father who sent Me that of all He has given Me I should lose nothing but should raise it up at the last day,  Enɛ lɛ Nyankopɔn ebaŋwɔmi ni ebi ɔhɔ he lɛ mɛwo ma ahe wɛ dɔ hɛ

   The Jews then complained of Him because He said 'I am the bread which came down from heaven',  a Yudafoi no ḿbɔ yɔ akɛ nɛ bɔ “Miŋ nyɛmɛ ahe wɔ fɛɛ”
   And they said 'Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know? How is it then that He says 'I have come down from heaven'?',  Ni amɛhe nɔ akɛ “Na ebi ni Yesu Joseph nɛ fɛɛmɛ mɛ hahe ni jɔɛ? Akɛ na ɛni lɛ nɛ yɔ ‘Miŋ nyɛmɛ ahe’?
   Jesus therefore answered and said to them 'Do not murmur among yourselves,  Yesu shishi nɔ akɛ “Nɛ bɛ bɔni bɛ nɔ akɛ”
   No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him and I will raise him up at the last day',  Nɛ ebi nɛbɔ nɔ lɛ na Nyankopɔn nɛ hɛ bɛ lɛ nɛ mɛbɛ ma ebi yɛni ahe wɛ
   It is written in the prophets 'And they shall all be taught by God' Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me,  Ni ahe bɔ nɛ asɛm ‘Ni Nyankopɔn ni ebi nɛ yɔ’ Kɛkɛ amɛyɔ ebi ni nyɛ Nyankopɔn bɛ yɔ

   The Jews therefore quarreled among themselves saying 'How can this Man give us His flesh to eat?',  a Yudafoi no ḿbɔ lɛ akɛ “Nɛ ḿbɛsɛmɛ he nɛ akɛ ‘Gba no ahe lɛ? Ahe?”
   Then Jesus said to them 'Most assuredly I say to you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood you have no life in you,  Ni Yesu kɛɛ nɔ akɛ “Nɔ lɛ nɛ nɛ bɛdɔ hɛn nɛ ni ebi nɛ bɛsɛmɛ lɛ ni bɔ ni amɛyɛ nɛ bɛ dɔ lɛ”

   These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum,  Enɛ ahe nɛ shishi lɛ lɛ Kapernaum
   Therefore many of His disciples when they heard this said 'This is a hard saying who can understand it?',  Kɛkɛ ni nɛ amɛngɔ nɛ amɛyɔ ebi “Enɛ lɛ nɛ ɛni lɛ ahe ɛhe ni mɛlɛ”
   When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples complained about this He said to them 'Does this offend you?,  Ni Yesu yɛ adɛmɔ mɛnɛ akɛ nɛ amɛngɔ bɔ akɛ “Nɛ amɛshɛ ebi?”

   Then those who heard it being convicted by their conscience went out one by one beginning with the oldest even to the last And Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst,  b Be ni amɛnu nɔ ni ekɛɛ lɛ amɛbɔ̃i kpojee ekomekome kɛjɛ klɛŋklɛŋ mɔ nɔ kɛyashi sɛɛkpee mɔ nɔ ni bashwɛ Yesu kome kɛkɛ kɛ yoo lɛ ni edãmɔ te lɛ mli

   The Pharisees therefore said to Him 'You bear witness of Yourself Your witness is not true',  No hewɔ lɛ Farisifoi lɛ kɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Bo lɛ bo diɛŋtsɛ ohe odase oyeɔ odase lɛ bɛ mli”
   Jesus answered and said to them 'Even if I bear witness of Myself My witness is true for I know where I came from and where I am going but you do not know where I come from and where I am going',  e Yesu here nɔ ekɛɛ “Kɛ miiye mi diɛŋtsɛ mihe odase hu jiŋŋ midase lɛ anɔkwale ni ejaakɛ mile he ni mijɛ kɛ he ni miyaa shi nyɛ lɛ nyɛleee he ni mijɛ aloo he ni miyaa

   Then they said to Him 'Where is Your Father?' Jesus answered 'You know neither Me nor My Father If you had known Me you would have known My Father also',  h Kɛkɛ ni amɛbi lɛ akɛ “Nɛgbɛ oTsɛ lɛ yɔɔ?” Yesu here nɔ akɛ “Nyɛko a anka miiye ni nɛgbɛ nyɛ ko anka nɛgbɛ nɔŋ Tsɛ nɔ”
   These words Jesus spoke in the treasury as He taught in the temple and no one laid hands on Him for His hour had not yet come,  i Mɛi mli Yesu diɛŋtsɛ lɛ akɛɛ wɔsuyei mɔ ni amɛ tsɔŋɔɔ lɛ ni mɔ ko bɛ maa eŋɔɔ ni eba tsu kɛ nɔ yehe nɔ mɔ
   Then Jesus said to them again 'I am going away and you will seek Me and as I said to the Jews 'Where I am going you cannot come',  j Kɛkɛ ni Yesu kɛ amɛ wie ekɛɛ “Mi lɛ tuŋ ni nyɛ lɛ bɛ no eŋɔ ni ebɔko eJew lɛ ‘Nɛgbɛ mɔ lɛ nyɛ lɛ mɔ mɔ”

   Then they said to Him 'Who are You?' And Jesus said to them 'Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning',  n Kɛkɛ ni amɛbɛ lɛ akɛ “Ejaakɛ ko!” Ni Yesu here nɔ akɛ “Mɛmɛ bo akɛ mɔ ni me so eŋko jɛmɔ”

   They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father,  p b Nɔ nyɛ ni nyɛtɔ ni Yesu kɛ amɛ nɔ aŋmɛ lɛ

   Now as Jesus passed by He saw a man who was blind from birth,  Ni be ni Yesu hoɔ lɛ ena nuu ko ni eshwila kɛjɛ efɔmɔ mli

   When He had said these things He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,  e Be ni ekɛɛ enɛ lɛ etsɛ̃ lajɔ̃ efɔ̃ shikpɔŋ ni ekɛ lajɔ̃ lɛ kpɔtɔ su ni ekɛ su lɛ kpa shwilafo lɛ hiŋmɛii anɔ
   And He said to him 'Go wash in the pool of Siloam' (which is translated Sent) So he went and washed and came back seeing,  ni ekɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Yaaju ohe yɛ Siloam (eshishi ji Mɔ ni atsu lɛ) Kpaakpo lɛ mli” Kɛkɛ ni etee eyaju ehe ni eba ni eena nii

   Therefore they said to him 'How were your eyes opened?',  No hewɔ lɛ amɛbi lɛ akɛ “Te fee tɛŋŋ ni ohiŋmɛii lɛ gbeleŋ?”

   Then they said to him 'Where is He?' He said 'I do not know',  Kɛkɛ ni amɛbi lɛ akɛ “Nɛgbɛ eyɔɔ?” Eto he akɛ “Mileee”
   They brought him who formerly was blind to the Pharisees,  Ni amɛŋɔ mɔ ni tsutsu ni eshwila lɛ kɛtee Farisifoi lɛ aŋɔɔ
   Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes,  f Shi gbi ni Yesu kpɔtɔ su ni ekɛgbele ehiŋmɛii lɛ Hejɔɔmɔ gbi ni

   And other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they will hear My voice and there will be one flock and one shepherd,  Miyɛ toi krokomɛi ni jɛɛɛ toi atsu nɛɛ mli ni nomɛi hu ja miŋɔ amɛ kɛba ni amɛbanu migbee ni toi lɛ fee kuu kome kɛ kwɛlɔ kome
   Therefore My Father loves Me because I lay down My life that I may take it again,  No hewɔ ni Tsɛ lɛ sumɔɔ mi lɛ ejaakɛ mikɛ miwala ŋmɛɔ shi koni maŋɔ ekoŋŋ
   No one takes it from Me but I lay it down of Myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again This command I have received from My Father,  Mɔ ko shɔ̃ɔɔ yɛ midɛŋ shi moŋ mi diɛŋtsɛ mikɛŋmɛɔ shi miyɛ hewalɛ akɛ mikɛŋmɛɔ shi ni miyɛ hewalɛ akɛ miŋɔɔ ekoŋŋ bɔ ni Tsɛ lɛ kɛɛ mi nɛ
   Therefore there was a division again among the Jews because of these sayings,  Wiemɔi nɛɛ ahewɔ lɛ mligbalamɔ saa ba Yudafoi lɛ ateŋ ekoŋŋ
   And many of them said 'He has a demon and is mad Why do you listen to Him?',  Ni amɛteŋ mɛi pii kɛɛ “Mumɔ fɔŋ yɛ emli ni eye sɛkɛ mɛɛhewɔ nyɛboɔ lɛ toi?”
   Others said 'These are not the words of one who has a demon Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?',  Mɛi komɛi hu kɛɛ “Jeee mɔ ni mumɔ fɔŋ yɔɔ emli wiemɔi nɛ Ani mumɔ fɔŋ aaanyɛ shwilafoi ahiŋmɛii agbele?”
   Now it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem and it was winter,  Agbɛnɛ aaye Sɔlemɔtsu Nɔjɔɔmɔ Gbijurɔ yɛ Yerusalɛm ni fɛ̃ibe mli ni
   And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch,  Ni Yesu miishara shi yɛ Sɔlemɔ we lɛ yɛ Solomon koi lɛ shi
   Then the Jews surrounded Him and said to Him 'How long do You keep us in doubt? If You are the Christ tell us plainly',  Kɛkɛ ni Yudafoi lɛ babɔle ehe ni amɛkɛɛ lɛ akɛ “Mɛɛ beyinɔ nɔŋŋ ooohã wɔyiŋ afee wɔ kɔshikɔshi kɛyashi? Kɛ bo ji Kristo lɛ kɛɛmɔ wɔ faŋŋ”
   Jesus answered them 'I told you and you do not believe The works that I do in My Father's name they bear witness of Me',  Yesu here amɛ nɔ akɛ “Mikɛɛ nyɛ momo shi nyɛheee nyɛyeee Nitsumɔi ni mitsuɔ yɛ miTsɛ gbɛi mli lɛ nomɛi miiye mihe odase
   But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep as I said to you,  shi nyɛ moŋ ni nyɛheee nyɛyeee ejaakɛ nyɛjeee mitoi lɛ eko
   My sheep hear My voice and I know them and they follow Me,  Mitoi lɛ nuɔ migbee ni mile amɛ ni amɛnyiɛɔ misɛɛ
   And I give them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand,  ni mihãa amɛ naanɔ wala ni amɛhiɛ kpãtãŋ kɛaatee naanɔ ni asaŋ mɔ ko shɔŋ amɛ yɛ midɛŋ
   My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father's hand,  MiTsɛ ni ŋɔ amɛ ehã mi lɛ fe mɛi fɛɛ ni mɔ ko nyɛŋ ashɔ̃ amɛ yɛ miTsɛ dɛŋ
   I and My Father are one,  Mi kɛ Tsɛ lɛ fɛɛ lɛ ekomeŋ
   Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him,  Kɛkɛ ni Yudafoi lɛ kɔlɔ tɛi ekoŋŋ akɛ amɛbaatswia lɛ
   Jesus answered them 'Many good works I have shown you from My Father For which of those works do you stone Me?',  Yesu here amɛ nɔ akɛ “Mitsɔ̃ɔ nyɛ nitsumɔi kpakpai pii ni jɛ miTsɛ ŋɔɔ te nakai nitsumɔi lɛ ateŋ nɔ hewɔ ni nyɛtaoɔ mi tɛi nyɛtswia nɛɛ?”
   The Jews answered Him saying 'For a good work we do not stone You but for blasphemy and because You being a man make Yourself God',  Yudafoi lɛ here lɛ nɔ amɛkɛɛ “Jeee nitsumɔ kpakpa ko hewɔ wɔbaatswia bo tɛi lɛ shi moŋ musubɔɔ hewɔŋ ejaakɛ bo ni gbɔmɔ ji bo lɛ ootsɛ ohe Nyɔŋmɔ”
   Jesus answered them 'Is it not written in your law 'I said You are gods'?,  Yesu here amɛ nɔ akɛ “Ani aŋmako yɛ nyɛMla lɛ mli akɛ ‘Mikɛɛ nyɔŋmɔi ji nyɛ?’
   If He called them gods to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),  Kɛji mɛi aŋɔɔ ni Nyɔŋmɔ wiemɔ lɛ ba lɛ tete lɛ etsɛ amɛ nyɔŋmɔi ni anyɛŋ ŋmalɛ lɛ mli aku lɛ
   do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world 'You are blaspheming' because I said 'I am the Son of God'?,  nyɛmiikɛɛ mɔ ni Tsɛ lɛ efee lɛ krɔŋkrɔŋ ni etsu lɛ kɛba je lɛ mli lɛ akɛ ‘Obɔ musu’ akɛni mikɛɛ akɛ ‘Nyɔŋmɔ Bi ji mi’ lɛ?
   If I do not do the works of My Father do not believe Me,  Kɛjeee miTsɛ nitsumɔi mitsuɔ lɛ no lɛ nyɛkahea mi nyɛyea
   but if I do though you do not believe Me believe the works that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me and I in Him,  shi kɛji no mitsuɔ ni kɛ̃lɛ nyɛheee mi nyɛyeee lɛ nyɛhea nitsumɔi lɛ kɛkɛ nyɛyea mɔ koni nyɛle ni nyɛhe nyɛye akɛ Tsɛ lɛ yɛ mimli ni mi hu miyɛ Tsɛ lɛ mli
   Therefore they sought again to seize Him but He escaped out of their hand,  No hewɔ lɛ amɛmiitao ekoŋŋ akɛ amɛmɔ lɛ shi eje amɛdɛŋ
   And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first and there He stayed,  Ni eyiŋ etee Yordan sɛɛ ekoŋŋ he ni Yohane baptisi yɛ tsutsu lɛ ni eyahi jɛi
   Then many came to Him and said 'John performed no sign but all the things that John spoke about this Man were true',  Ni mɛi pii ba eŋɔɔ ni amɛkɛɛ “Yohane efeee naakpɛɛnii ko moŋ shi nii fia a ni ewie yɛ nuu nɛɛ he lɛ anɔkwaŋ”
   And many believed in Him there,  Ni mɛi pii he enɔ amɛye yɛ jɛi
