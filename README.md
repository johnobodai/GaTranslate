# Ga-English Translation Model

## Overview
This project implements a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for translating text from English to Ga. The model was trained on a dataset of English sentences and their corresponding Ga translations.

## Dataset Creation and Preprocessing Steps

1. **Dataset Source**: The dataset consists of English sentences and their corresponding translations in Ga. It was manually sourced from the Gosple of John(NWT version of the bible).
   
2. **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file.

3. **Tokenization**:
   - **NLP Library**: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) was used for tokenization.
   - **Process**: Sentences in both English and Ga were tokenized and converted to lowercase.

4. **Numerical Representation**:
   - Each word was converted to a numerical representation. Initially, the lengths of the words were used for simplicity, but this was later replaced with integer sequences generated by a Keras tokenizer.

5. **Padding**: 
   - Sequences were padded to ensure uniform length using Keras's `pad_sequences` method.

6. **Train-Test Split**:
   - The dataset was split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Architecture and Design Choices

1. **Model Type**: A Seq2Seq architecture with LSTM was chosen for the translation task due to its ability to handle sequential data effectively.

2. **Encoder-Decoder Structure**:
   - **Encoder**: 
     - Input layer to accept tokenized English sentences.
     - An embedding layer to create dense representations of input words.
     - An LSTM layer to process the input sequence and capture its hidden state.
   - **Decoder**: 
     - Input layer for Ga translations.
     - An embedding layer similar to the encoder.
     - An LSTM layer that receives the encoder's hidden state and outputs a sequence of predictions.
     - A dense layer with a softmax activation function to predict the next word in the translation.

3. **Loss Function**: 
   - Sparse categorical crossentropy was used for the loss function, suitable for multi-class classification problems.

4. **Optimizer**: 
   - Adam optimizer was utilized for its efficiency and adaptive learning capabilities.

## Insights and Potential Improvements

1. **Insights**:
   - The model demonstrates a basic capability to translate English sentences to Ga, but there are areas for improvement.
   - Analyzing misclassifications can help identify specific weaknesses in the translation process.

2. **Potential Improvements**:
   - **Data Augmentation**: Increase the dataset size by incorporating more diverse sentence structures and vocabulary.
   - **Advanced Models**: Experiment with more advanced architectures like Transformers, which have shown to outperform LSTMs in NLP tasks.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
   - **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune the model on domain-specific data if available.
